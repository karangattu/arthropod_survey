Unknown Funnel Weaver Spider,Arachnida (Arachnids),Araneae (Spiders),Ageleninae (Typical Funnel Weavers),Unknown,Unknown,"Funnel weaver spiders are generally brownish or grayish spiders with a body typically ranging from1/3 to 2/3-inch when full grown. They have four pairs of eyes that are roughly the same size. The legs and body are hairy and legs usually have some dark banding. They are often mistaken for wolf spiders (Lycosidae family) but the size and pattern of eyes can most easily distinguish them. Like wolf spiders, the funnel weavers are very fast runners.
Among the three most common genera (Agelenopsis, Hololena, Tegenaria) found in homes and around yards, Agelenopsis (Figures 1, 2 and 3) is perhaps most easily distinguished as it has long tail-like structures extending from the rear end of the body. These structures are the spider’s spinnerets, from which the silk emerges. Males of this genus have a unique and peculiarly coiled structure (embolus) on their pedipalps (Figure 3), the appendages next to the mouthparts.
Hololena species often have similar appearance but lack the elongated spinnerets and male pedipalps have a normal clubbed appearance. Spiders within both genera usually have dark longitudinal bands that run along the back of the cephalothorax and an elongated abdomen.
Tegenaria species tend to have blunter abdomens marked with gray or black patches. Dark bands may also run along the cephalothorax, which is reddish brown with yellowish hairs in the species Tegenaria domestica (Figure 4). The four pairs of eyes are arranged in two, slightly curved rows, which is a more orderly arrangement than found on other funnel weaver spiders."
Brown Widow,Arachnida (Arachnids),Araneae (Spiders),Theridiidae (Cobweb Spiders),Latrodectus,geometricus,"L. geometricus is slightly smaller and generally lighter in color than the black widow species; the color can range from tan to dark brown to black, with shades of grey also possible. Like the black widow species in the United States, L. geometricus has a prominent hourglass-shaped marking on the underside of the abdomen; the brown widow's hourglass, however, is usually a vivid orange or a yellowish color. Unlike the black widow, L. geometricus has a black-and-white geometric pattern on the dorsal side of its abdomen. They also have stripes on their legs.

Brown widows can be located by finding their egg sacs, which are easily identifiable. They resemble a sandspur, having pointed projections all over,[4] and they are sometimes described as ""tufted"", ""fluffy"",[4] or ""spiky"" in appearance. Eggs hatch in approximately 20 days.[5] Female brown widows lay about 120–150 eggs per sac and can make 20 egg sacs over a lifetime."

There is only one sensillum on the leg metatarsus.[5] The prosoma is yellow-brown, with a leaf-like mark on the opisthosoma. The abdomen has a silvery sheen due to guanine crystals below the skin. Adult females are recognizable from their grey banded legs and pattern of dark grey waves on their dorsal side. Adult males are smaller than adult females, and display a dark dorsal exterior with dark brown legs and cephalothorax. The male abdomen is smaller and less marked with a shiny cream color than the female abdomen. In moderate climate, adults appear from July to October, sometimes even into December. In warmer regions, Z. x-notata is active all year. The common name missing sector orb weaver comes from the distinctive structure of Z. x-notata's web."
